# FAVITES-COVID-Lite
A simplified (and much faster) simulation pipeline specifically for COVID-19 contact + transmission + phylogeny + sequence simulation

## Dependencies:
* [NiemaGraphGen](https://github.com/niemasd/NiemaGraphGen) to simulate contact networks
* [GEMF](https://github.com/niemasd/GEMF) to simulate transmission networks
* [CoaTran](https://github.com/niemasd/CoaTran) to simulate phylogenies
* [Seq-Gen](https://github.com/rambaut/Seq-Gen) to simulate sequences
